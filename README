This repository is a new home for the segmentation algorithm, originally described in 'Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation, Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher, International Journal of Computer Vision, 59(2) September 2004.'

 The program accepts a color image (PPM format) and outputs a segmentation with a random color assigned to each region.

Instructions:
1) Run 'make' to compile 'segment'.
2) Execute 'segment sigma k min input output'.
The parameters are:
 sigma: Used to smooth the input image before segmenting it.
 k: Value for the threshold function.
 min: Minimum component si
